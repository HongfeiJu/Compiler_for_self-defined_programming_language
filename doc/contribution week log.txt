Zachary Wang:
1. Organize the data structure in the language
    

Hongfei Ju：
1. Design the primitive type (boolean and int) and operator
2. Design the parsing technique (bottom-up) and needed data structure (symbaol table) [prototype design,simple descripton]
3. First version grammer [includes all the data types and constructs that are required, need further revision from other group memeber]
