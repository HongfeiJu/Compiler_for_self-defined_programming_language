SER502-Spring2018-Team-24
-----------------------------------------------------
Hongfei Ju:
1. Setting and editing the Github repository
2. preliminary design of the language
   2.1. design the primitive type (boolean and int) and operator
   2.2. design the parsing technique (bottom-up) and needed data structure (linked list) [prototype design, simple description)
   2.3. first version grammar [includes all the data types and constructs that are required, need further revision from other group memeber]

-----------------------------------------------------
Zachary Wang:
1. Provide the ideas and skills of the compiler design
   1.1. Implementation of lexical analyzers with Flex
   1.2. Implementation of parsers with YACC
   1.3. The concept of intermediate codes and assembly codes
2. Provide the interpreter part, including the concept and content

-----------------------------------------------------
Ruihao Zhou:
1. Learn how to use Github and Study on the prerequisites for Compiler knowledge 
2. Try to implement lexical and parser analysis by using python
3. Working on the related document for Milestone 2
   3.1 Edit READ.ME
   3.2 In charge of contribution.txt
4. Provide insight into Compiler design 

-----------------------------------------------------
contribution plan for following weeks

ps: every member will participate the implementation of all the components of the compiler.

Every component will be assigned to one major contributor, which is as follows:

1. Lexer: Ruihao Zhou
2. Parser: Hongfei Ju
3. Intermediate code generator: Zachary Wang
4. runtime: Hongfei Ju/Ruihao Zhou
